# ---- Exam Start ----

## Academic Honesty Statement

The following statement is provided in your `midterm-starter.Rmd`:

*I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, hereby state that I will not communicate with or gain information in any way from my classmates, or copy work from past assignments, during this exam, and that all work is my own.*

Please complete the blank section above (`___`) with your name.

## Warm up

Before we start, let's warm up by updating the YAML.

-   Change the author name to your name and enter today's date in the starter file YAML.
-   **Knit** the document. üß∂
-   **Commit** your changes with a meaningful commit message. ‚úÖ
-   **Push** your changes to GitHub. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

If you have any problems pushing changes, let us know now!

## Loading packages and Data

We will need `tidyverse` packages and functions, and will be using the `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package.

```{r photo, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.cap = "Penguins Dataset", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/penguins.png")
```

The code chunk below will load the two packages and is also provided in your starter file.

```{r load-packages, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

# Inspecting Data

There are several ways to inspect a data frame.
One method is to use the `glimpse()` function.
Other methods include using `View()` or `?` help pages.

1.  **(5 points)** Under Ex. 1 in your starter file, write and label a code chunk that uses `glimpse()` to allow you to inspect the `penguins` dataset. After your code chunk, state **(1)** how many rows and variables there are in the `penguins` dataset and **(2)**, of the variables, how many are categorical and how many are numerical.

In a tidy data frame, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation.

2.  **(5 points)** Under Ex. 2 in your starter file, write and label a code chunk that uses `names()` to allow you to inspect the variable names in the `penguins` dataset. After your code chunk, explain why the names are "good". Think about the things we normally fix when we read data in that contains bad names.

Each row of the `penguins` dataset describes the physical characteristics of a penguin sampled in Antarctica.
We might wonder: how many observations do we have for each `species`?

3.  **(5 points)** Under Ex. 3 in your starter file, write and label a code chunk that uses the `count()` function to output the number of observations (rows) for each `species` of penguin in the `penguins` dataset.

```{marginfigure}
**Hint:** remember you can use help pages to look at function syntax.
After your code chunk, state the pair of data wrangling functions we could have used instead to generate a similar output.
```

# Exploratory visualization

Rather than looking at a summary table of species counts, we might want to visualize the number of penguins of each species, and the number observed for each island studied.

4.  **(5 points)** Under Ex. 4 in your starter file, copy and complete the code chunk provided below that will generate a bar plot of penguin observations by `island`. The fill aesthetic of each bar will vary with `species`. Under your completed code chunk, state which islands each species of penguins was observed at.

```{r visualize-penguin-island-species, eval = F}
___ %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ___, fill = ___)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_classic()
```

Scatter plots also provide useful visualizations of data.
We might wonder: how does penguin body mass vary with flipper length, for each species?

5.  **(5 points)** Under Ex. 5 in your starter file, copy and complete the code chunk provided below that will generate scatter plots of penguin `body_mass_g` (x-axis) against `flipper_length_mm` (y-axis). The color and shape aesthetics of each histogram will vary with `species`. Under the completed code chunk, (1) state whether you think there is an association between the two variables, and (2) make one other observation about what differs between `Gentoo` penguins and the other two species.

```{r visualize-penguin-body-mass, eval = F}
___ %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ___, y = ___, color = ___, shape = ___)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```

# Wrangling data

We might want to just focus on analyzing penguin flipper length for one species and how it varies with the categorical variables.

6.  **(10 points)** Under Ex. 6 in your starter file, write and label a code chunk that takes `penguins` as input and uses a pipeline of wrangling functions to: (1) **select** `flipper_length_mm` and all the categorical variables; (2) **filter** for one penguin `species` of your choice; and (3) assign the output to a new data object. You can give the new data object a sensible name of your choosing that follows the guidelines for naming object in R programming.

# Recoding data

The following code chunk, which is also provided for you in the starter file, uses a violin plot to visualize the distribution of penguin flipper lengths by penguins sex.
Note, you will need to add the data object you just created as the input dataset and set `eval = T` to get the chunk to run in your starter file.

```{r visualize-penguin-flipper-length, eval = F}
___ %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_violin() +
  theme_classic()
```

7.  **(5 points)**

-   Under Ex. 7 in your starter file, state why `female` appears on the left, `male` appears in the middle, and `NA` appears on the right.
-   In your response, make reference to the data type/class of the sex `variable` and the two components that make up that data class.
-   Then, copy the code chunk below into your starter file, and complete it such that it outputs a violin plot with `male` on the left and `female` on the right. The code chunk will also filter out the missing `sex` values first.

```{r recode-sex-levels, eval = F}
___ %>% 
  filter(!is.na(___)) %>% 
  mutate(sex = fct_relevel(sex, "___", "___")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_violin() +
    theme_classic()
```

# Reading and correcting data

There is a version of `penguins` in the `/data` folder within your midterm project.
Take a look at what it is called.
There are a few issues with this version of the penguins dataset.
**All the problems with the data are located within the top 5 rows.**

8.  **(10 points)**

-   Write and label a code chunk that will read the problematic dataset from your data folder, into R, and assign the data to the object `penguins_with_issues`.
-   In a second, separate *line of code*, under your read function, use `glimpse()` to view the columns and first few rows of `penguins_with_issues`.
-   Identify and state under your code chunk, the two types of problems with this data set.
-   Finally, copy and paste your first read code chunk below your narrative response, and give it a unique label.
-   Edit this second code chunk so that the data is corrected during or after it is read in.

```{marginfigure}
(**Hint**: Examine the `name_repair` argument option in the read function help page for one method. Alternatively, pipe the read function output into a line that uses a function from the package `janitor`.)
```

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your final changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

Great work!
If you finish early, please respect your class mates by leaving the room quietly.
See you next Tuesday!
